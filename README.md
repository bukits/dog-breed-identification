# Image-based dog breed identification with Deep Learning
## AIT Deep Learning Project Work

### Abstract
The main goal of this project is the classification of dog breed with a deep
learning approach. The solution identifies, which dog breed appears on a given
picture. There are currently different breeds supported in the training set. However, the range of supported breed is freely expandable.
For the perfect user experience our aim is to develop an IOS application for detecting the unseen dogs breed.
