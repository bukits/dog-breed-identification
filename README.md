# Image-based dog breed identification with Deep Learning
## AIT Deep Learning Project Work

### Abstract
The main goal of this project is to find a solution to classify dog breeds with a deep learning approach. Given pictures of different dogs, the solution should identify which breeds the dogs are. Currently, 120 different breeds are supported in our training set, but later, the range of supported breeds could be expanded based on needs.
In order to have a better user experience, we aim to develop an IOS application for detecting dog breeds using the above solution we have.
